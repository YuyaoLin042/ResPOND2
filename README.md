This archive contains the supplementary materials accompanying the paper submission.  
All contents have been anonymized in accordance with the CHI submission policy.

## File Overview

### 1. `Processing_GCode_SignalVisualize/`
Processing sketch that visualizes the fluctuation signals collected by the device.  
Used to generate real-time graphical representations of surface movement, subsurface vibration, and other sensor data.

### 2. `ResPOND_Arduino/`
Main Arduino code for operating the prototype device.  
Implements sensor initialization, threshold-based signal comparison, and actuation control (tablet dispenser, motors, and LED indicators).

### 3. `3DModels.3mf`
3D printing slice files of the prototype.  
Contains the structural parts required for fabricating and assembling the device housing and dispensing mechanism.

### 4. `index.html`
Interactive visualization mock-up created to support explanation of the project concept.  
Provides an illustrative interface, not part of the deployed hardware prototype.

### 5. `Survey_ResPOND.pdf`
Questionnaire and results from a post-prototype survey with 60 fish farmers.  
Includes multiple-choice responses regarding usability, perceived usefulness, and potential adoption of the device.  
All data are aggregated and anonymized.
